# Kill 'em
## (Just a game title I'm not encouraging you to do anything)

This game is just a fun project inspired by Katana Zero(it might not look like that) and awesome sprites that I found on itch.io. I was experimenting with creating a platformer movement that will satisfy me and also that I can implement.

## Installation
No instalation required, the latest build placed in ` ./exports/Best Movement fin.exe `
